# AI Debate App

## Introduction
Debate-App is a web application that enables a back-and-forth conversation between two Language Models (LLMs) on a topic chosen by the user. Users can select any two models, input a query, and visualize the dialogue between the LLMs in real-time. Built using Unify and deployed with Streamlit, this application provides a platform for users to witness AI-generated debates and explore the capabilities of different language models.
